# Neurotoxic Effects of Lead Exposure

- Decades of research support the association between blood lead levels and neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, often even at blood lead levels below the CDC reference level of 5 $\mu g/dL$.

- Cognitive, intellectual, and behavioral deficits in children:

    + Decreased scores on end-of-grade reading exams
    
    + IQ deficits
    
    + Increased hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors
    
- Effects of childhood lead exposure lasting into adulthood:  
    
    +  Decreased gray matter in regions of the brain associated with executive functions, mood regulation, and decision-making
    
    + Association with higher rates of arrests for all offenses and violent offenses

---

# Lead Exposure Pathways

- Ingestion

    + Deterioration of lead-based materials, such as paint
    
    + Hand-to-mouth contact, contaminated food or drink
    
- Remobilization of lead deposited in the bones

    + Maternal lead deposited into bones during development
    
    + Leach into the body during entire lifecourse
    
- Inhalation

    + Nearby stationary sources (i.e., industrial facilities)
    
    + Ambient levels due to mobile sources (i.e., traffic-related air pollution)
    
    + U.S. EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) threshold of 150 $ng/m^3$ not to be exceeded as a rolling three-month average
    
---

# Measuring Exposure to Lead

- Blood Lead

    + Representative of mostly ingested lead (70%) and lead leached from the bones
    
    + Only 3% of lead in blood is due to inhalation
    
- Air Sampling

    + Difficult to measure concentrations of lead that may travel to brain through airway
    
    + Measure levels of lead in air surrounding area of interest, such as the home
    
    + Health effects specifically associated with airborne lead exposure can be overlooked if only measure of exposure is blood lead level

# Sensitive Windows of Exposure

.pull-left[
- Most studies assess exposure at one time point or average exposure over a period of time.

- If time and developmental window chosen for study is not time at which children are most sensitive to the exposure, could miss or underestimate effects.

# Study Population

- Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS)

- Prospective birth cohort of children born October 2001 to July 2003 in the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan region. 

- Study eligibility required:

    + Having a birth record address either farther than 1,500m or less than 400m from a major highway
    
    + Having at least one biologic parent with allergic sensitization verified by skin prick testing

# Temporal Scaling of Airborne Pb Exposures

- To account for temporal variability in airborne Pb levels, scaled LURF estimates using air quality (AQS) measurements from EPA

- Constructed scaling factors from air Pb measurements derived from total PM measured every 3 to 6 days at EPA monitoring stations centrally located in our study area

- One scaling factor for each month of each participant's life, from birth through twelfth birthday: monthly air Pb divided by average air Pb from 2001 to 2005

- Multiplied scaling factor by corresponding annual air Pb estimate from LURF model

**Example**

birthdate: October 9, 2001

$$
\small
\frac{EPA\ avg\ Pb\ Oct.\ 9\ to\ Nov.\ 9} {EPA\ avg\ Pb\ 2001\ to\ 2005}\ *\ Age\ 1\ LURF\ Estimate\ =\ Month\ 1\ Pb\ Estimate
$$

# Child Behavioral Assessment

- BASC-2 (Behavioral Assessment for Children, Parent Rating Scale, 2nd edition) completed by CCAAPS parents at 12-year visit

- Assess behavioral and emotional status of children and young adults in community and home settings, and aid in clinical diagnoses of behavioral and emotional disorders

- Population normalized t-scores, with higher scores being related to more problematic behaviors. A score of 59 or greater is used to identify a clinically significant problematic behavior.

# Confounding Pathways

![](dagitty-model-final.png)

---

# Confounding Pathways

- **Maternal education level**

    + Reported at age 1 visit
    
    + High school degree or less or trade school, some college, college or graduate school

- **Blood lead level at age 12**

    + Accounts for lead exposure from sources other than air pollution

- **Community deprivation**

    + Index based on 6 socioeconomic census tract-level measures

- **Residential greenspace**

    + NDVI within 400 m of the home

- **Elemental carbon attributable to traffic (ECAT) exposure**

    + Accounts for non-lead air pollution

# Statistical Modeling: Multiple Linear Regression

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + ... + \beta_{144}x_{i144} + \varepsilon_i$$

where each $x_{ij}$ is the estimate of air Pb exposure during month $j$ of life for participant $i$ 

- A sensitive window would be defined as the period of exposure in which the 95% confidence interval(s) for the corresponding coefficient(s) do not include zero. 

**Drawbacks**

- Exposure in consecutive months likely to be correlated, resulting in unreliable standard errors, and therefore confidence intervals

- Requires estimation of 145 $\beta$ terms

---

# Statistical Modeling: Distributed Lag Models (DLMs)

- In general, DLMs predict current values of an outcome based on current and past ("lagged") values of an exposure

- Defines a third "lag" dimension

- Flexibility to model different exposure-response relationships, as well as different time-response relationships

- Can use this concept to deal with the collinearity problem caused by correlated exposures by requiring model coefficients to lie on some curve

---

# Statistical Modeling: Using Splines to Restrict DLM Coefficients

Recall the multiple regression model: $\small Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + ... + \beta_{144} x_{i144} + \varepsilon_i$

We can impose additional form on each $\beta$ coefficient such that it follows the form of a natural spline. 


.pull-left[
$$
\beta_j = \theta_1 +\theta_2j + \theta_3N_3(j) + \theta_4N_4(j)
$$


where $\small N_1(x) = 1, N_2(x) = x,$

$\small N_{k+2}(x) = d_k(x) - d_{K-1}(x),$

$\small d_k(x) = \frac{(x - \xi_k)^3_+ - (x - \xi_K)^3_+} {\xi_K - \xi_k}$ , 

and $k$ is the number of knots $1, ..., K$

# Statistical Modeling: Using Splines to Restrict DLM Coefficients

Recall the multiple regression model: $\small Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + ... + \beta_{144} x_{i144} + \varepsilon_i$

We can impose additional form on each $\beta$ coefficient such that it follows the form of a natural spline. 

$$
\beta_j = \theta_1 +\theta_2j + \theta_3N_3(j) + \theta_4N_4(j)
$$

Then we can substitute the function for each $\beta_j$ into the multiple regression equation, and rearrange algebraically.

Now we can estimate 4 $\theta$ terms instead of 145 $\beta$ terms. The 4 $\theta$ estimates can then be substituted back into the equation to estimate the $\beta$ coefficients corresponding to each lag.

# Model for Identifying Sensitive Pb Exposure Windows for BASC Outcomes

$$\small Subscore_i = \alpha_0 + \sum_{j=0}^{144} \beta_j x_{ij} + \alpha_1 MaternalEducation_i + \alpha_2 BloodLead_i + \\ \small \alpha_3 Deprivation_i + \alpha_4 Greenspace_i + \alpha_5 ECAT_i + \varepsilon_i$$

where each where each $x_{ij}$ is the estimate of air Pb exposure for child $i$ in month $j$ of life, and there are additional constraints such that coefficients $\beta_j$ follow the form of a natural spline with 3 interior knots. The number of knots was chosen using AIC.

We tested whether or not the exposure-lag-response relationship differed among males and females by conducting an ANOVA. If the p-value was less than 0.05, we performed sex-stratified DLMs.

Estimated coefficients $\beta_j$ represent the change in BASC score associated with a 1 $\small ng/m^3$ increase in airborne lead during each month of life $j$. A sensitive window is defined as any month(s) in which the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient excluded zero.

# Discussion

- First study to find associations between airborne lead exposure and harmful effects on neurobehavioral health.

- We found significant associations between a range of neurobehavioral deficits at age 12 and early life exposure to airborne lead levels an **order of magnitude below the EPA NAAQS.**

- Future Work:

    + Choice of function to model time dimension
    
    + Choice of function to model exposure-response relationship (DLNMs)
    
    + Nonlinear confounders, interaction terms, lagged confounders
    
    + Replication in different cohort(s)
